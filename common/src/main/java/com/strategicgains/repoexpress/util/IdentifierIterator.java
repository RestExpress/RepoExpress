/**
 * An Iterator implementation iterating over the identifiers of an Iterable (collection) of
 * Identifiable instances.  Thus, it iterates the IDs of the underlying instances--instead
 * of the instances themselves.
 * <p/>
 * This means, that if you have a Collection of Identifiable instances, you can iterate over
 * the IDs of those Identifiable guys.  This is useful when creating queries and such using,
 * say the "in" operator.
 * <p/>
 * For example, this may be used as follows (psuedo-code):<br/>
 * List<BlogEntry> blogEntries = ... // list of blog entries we're deleting.<br/>
 * blogCommentsRepository.delete().where("blogEntryId").isIn(new IdentifierIterator(blogEntries));
